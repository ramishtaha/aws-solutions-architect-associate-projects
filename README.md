# 10 Hands-On Projects for AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) Preparation

## Introduction

Welcome to this comprehensive hands-on learning repository designed specifically for students preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect - Associate (SAA-C03) certification exam. This repository contains 10 carefully crafted projects that progressively build your practical experience with core AWS services while reinforcing key architectural concepts tested in the SAA-C03 exam.

Each project is designed to be:
- **Hands-on and practical**: You'll build real AWS solutions, not just read theory
- **Exam-focused**: Every project reinforces concepts directly tested in SAA-C03
- **Cost-conscious**: Most projects can be completed within AWS Free Tier limits
- **Progressive**: Projects increase in complexity to build your confidence gradually

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Project 1** and work through them sequentially for the best learning experience
2. **Follow the cleanup instructions** carefully after each project to avoid unnecessary costs
3. **Study the "Learning Materials & Key Concepts"** section of each project to understand the architectural principles
4. **Practice multiple times** - repetition is key to retaining the knowledge for the exam

## Learning Path Recommendation

- **Beginners**: Start with Projects 1-3 to build foundational knowledge
- **Intermediate learners**: Focus on Projects 4-7 for core architectural patterns
- **Advanced learners**: Challenge yourself with Projects 8-10 for complex scenarios

## Prerequisites

**ðŸš€ Before starting any projects, please complete the one-time setup by following our [Prerequisites Guide](./PREREQUISITES.md).**

The prerequisites guide covers:
- AWS Account creation and security setup (IAM user creation)
- AWS CLI installation and configuration  
- Recommended tools installation (VS Code, Git)
- Cost management and billing alerts setup

This setup takes about 30-45 minutes but is essential for all projects in this repository.

## Cost Considerations

Most projects in this repository are designed to work within AWS Free Tier limits. However, always:
- Monitor your AWS billing dashboard
- Follow cleanup instructions after each project
- Set up billing alerts using AWS Budgets (covered in Project 10)
